# bast
An RL library in PyTorch embedded within the PyTorch Lightning framework.

## Branch names
Branches should be using one of these groups to start with:
wip - Works in progress; stuff I know won't be finished soon (like a release)
feat - Feature I'm adding or expanding
bug - Bug fix or experiment
junk - Throwaway branch created to experiment

Groups should be split using "-". For example: junk-id-test

Skip the ID for now, since we don't have unique id generation in trello. Please add a label with the branch name to the card.

## Commit messages
Commit your work as often as possible. Push the changes in batches.
Each commit should have one line for each feature/change added.

Example of commit:
File x.py added
Gradient clipping fixed
Feature Y implemented

## Pull Requests
When finished with your work, create a pull request between the relevant branches. This would be discussed in our next meeting. Please add a label to trello to mark cards in need of review.
